      <p>I strive to overcome anything I put my mind to. My main goal in life is to be happy and to sustain myself doing what I love. I often spend my time crafting with the Arduino and 3d printer and hope to find a coding position that allows me to explore those interests in a professional setting. Jonah Hill most accurately represents my emotions in pursuing this wonderful opportunity.  </p>
